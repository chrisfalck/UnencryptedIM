To run this program, execute
    python3 UnencryptedIM.py -s 
on the server machine and 
    python3 UnencryptedIm.py -c IP_ADDRESS_OF_SERVER
on the client machine.

Due to conflicts in the CISE computer lab while using port 9999, this program runs on port 9456 by default.
This can be changed by editing the port variable declared at the top of UnencryptedIM.py.
